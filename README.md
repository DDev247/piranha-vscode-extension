# Piranha VS Code Extension

This is the VS Code syntax highlighting extension for the Piranha scripting language.

# Installing

Go to your user folder in windows eg:
`C:\Users\Example\` then go to the folder named `.vscode` then in that go to `extensions` and unpack the code to a folder called piranha or something like that.
It would look something like this:  
`C:\Users\Example\.vscode\extensions\piranha-extension` <- code (package.json and other) in here.
